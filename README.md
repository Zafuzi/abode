Start by sending 1 probe to planet (including earth, max 1 per body)
After sending probe you can launch a GPS satellite (max 5 per body)
Then you can build a mesh network (max 10 per body)

Mesh network unlocks the next body and the above process must be repeated on the new body to reach a new one

Once you have a mesh network 10/10 on a body you can begin to send drones to start making buildings
You can send up to 10,000 drones and each package contains 1,000 (so 10 drone packages per body)
The drones will then start getting the body ready for colonization and a progress meter will appear for the chosen body (earth starts at 100%)

After 100% build progress, you can send a small crew (max 1 per body)
The crew makes a lot more/less? money and are really expensive to maintain and deliver
The crew will test the colony out for 1 year
After 1 year you can start sending large crews of 100 colonists (make lots of money, cost a lot to maintain moderate to deliver)

The colonists will start living and building on the new body
After 5 years of work you can use the new body as a starting point to save on the cost of sending from earth (lower gravity, higher resource cost)

After mars is fully colonized you can build a jump point from the moon to mars essentially make the cost to send from the moon free

After mars the next target is probably one of Jupiters moons. 

You win the game (easy mode?) after fully colonizing all the available bodies and still having positive income.



Too much negative balance will lower you budget at the end of the year.
Too much positive balance will reduce the speed of progress on each body. (min 10%)
You can increase efficieny and progress by sending a dedicated crew (max 2? per body)
To win, balance the balance you must.
